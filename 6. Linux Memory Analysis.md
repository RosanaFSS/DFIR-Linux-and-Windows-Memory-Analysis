<h2> Task 1 . Introduction</h2>

<p>When investigating a cyber incident, a system's memory is one of the most volatile and revealing sources of evidence. Memory forensics helps uncover valuable information about what was happening on a machine at a specific time, such as running processes, open files, network connections, credentials, and more.<br><br><br>

In this room, we will continue our investigation of the APT attack on the TryHatMe company and look at the footprints that the adversary left behind in the memory of the Linux machine. It is suspected that the adversary got access to the Linux server via lateral movement.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>To understand the concepts and technicalities covered in this room, it is expected that the user is well-versed with Volatility and has covered the following rooms:</p>

- Volatility<br>
- Linux Live Analysis<br>
- Windows Memory & User Activity<br>
- Windows Memory & Processes</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p> In this room, we will examine the footprints of the adversary's actions in the compromised Linux server. Some of the key topics that we will cover are:<br>

- Overview of the Linux and Windows memory layout.<br>
- Learn how to utilize Volatility to investigate Linux memory.<br>
- Learn how to investigate the running processes and network connections and identify the odd ones.</p>

<p>Let's dive in.</p>

<h2> Task 2 . Scenario Information</h2>
<p>This is the continuation of the scenario covered in the previous rooms. We will focus on the Linux Server compromised via lateral movement in this room. </p>

<h3>Recapping the Scenario</h3>
<p></p>You are part of the incident response team handling an incident at TryHatMe - a company that exclusively sells hats online. You are tasked with analyzing a full memory dump of a potentially compromised Linux host. Before you, another analyst had already taken a full memory dump and gathered all the necessary information from the TryHatMe IT support team. Since this is your first case, you are a bit nervous, but don't worry; a senior analyst will guide you.</p>

<h3>Information Incident THM-0001</h3>

<p>

- On May 5th, 2025, at 07:30 CET, TryHatMe initiated its incident response plan and escalated the incident to us. After an initial triage, our team found a Windows host that was potentially compromised. This led to a full-scale investigation and discovered that the Linux server FS-01 was also compromised along with the Windows machines.<br>
- The details of the host are as follows:<br>
--- Hostname: FS-01<br>
--- OS: Linux 5.15.0-1066<br>
-At 07:45 CET, our analyst Steve Stevenson took a full memory dump of the Windows host and made a hash to ensure its integrity. The memory dump details are:<br>
--- Name: FS-01.mem<br>
--- MD5-hash: c0fbf40989bda765b8edaa41f72d3ee9<br>

<h2> Task 4 . Memory Overview: Linux vs Windows</h2>
<p>It is important to understand how memory works in Linux before starting to analyze the memory dump. While Linux and Windows utilize RAM for process execution, system caching, and runtime operations, their memory architectures, management, and artifacts differ substantially.<br><br>

This task provides an overview of Linux memory and how it contrasts with Windows memory systems. You’ll learn key concepts such as virtual memory, page tables, memory regions, and how memory appears in forensic dumps.</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Memory (RAM) is where active processes and kernel operations are stored during system operation. Both operating systems use virtual memory to give each process the illusion of having its own isolated memory space.<br><br>

However, their memory management models diverge in key areas:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3beadea9-4d83-4f54-bbc0-fd50653ea271)

<h3>How Linux Manages Memory</h3>
<p>

- Physical vs Virtual Memory: Every process is given a virtual address space. Using page tables, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) translates these to physical addresses.<br>
- Memory-mapped Files: Shared libraries and files are loaded into memory using <code>mmap()</code>. This helps in efficient sharing across processes.<br>
- Kernel Memory: Managed separately from normal programs. <br>
- Swap: When RAM is exhausted, less-used memory pages are moved to swap, freeing space.<br><br>

Linux and Windows both use virtual memory, but their internal structures and exposure to forensics tools differ. Linux provides more direct access to live memory views through the <code>/proc</code> filesystem, while Windows relies on kernel-level structures like Virtual Address Descriptors (VADs) to manage memory.
</p>

<h3>Recapping the Process</h3>
<p>A process is a fundamental unit of execution in an operating system. It represents a running instance of a program, including its memory, CPU context, and system resources. While both Linux and Windows support multitasking through processes, they differ significantly in how they structure, manage, and expose process data. Understanding these differences is vital in memory forensics and threat detection. At its core, a process includes a unique process ID (PID), a dedicated memory space, an execution context (like CPU registers and scheduling data), and a set of resources such as open files and network connections. A process consists of:</p>

<p>

- A PID (Process ID): A process ID (PID) is a unique identifier the operating system assigns to every active process. It enables tracking, managing, and referencing a process during its lifecycle.<br><br>
- Memory space: Each process gets its own virtual address space, broken into key regions:<br>
---Code segment: Contains executable instructions.<br>
---Heap: Dynamically allocated memory (e.g., via malloc()).<br>
----Stack: Manages function calls and local variables.<br>
----Memory-mapped files: Files mapped into memory (e.g., shared libraries, config files).<br>
- Execution context (registers, scheduling info): The execution context of a process or thread includes:<br><br>
---Register values: EIP/RIP for instruction pointer and ESP/RSP for stack pointer.<br>
---Program counter: Tracks instruction execution.<br>
---Scheduler metadata: Priority, CPU time, and state (running, sleeping, etc.).<br>
- Open File Descriptors: File descriptors (FDs) are integer handles pointing to open files, sockets, or pipes used by a process. On UNIX-like systems, this includes everything from log files to /dev/null to TCP ports.<br><br>
- Parent/Child Relationships (Process Tree): Processes are organized hierarchically. A parent spawns a child using system calls like fork() (Unix) or CreateProcess() (Windows). This forms a process tree, which is useful for tracing activity lineage.</p>


<p>Processes may spawn other processes, forming parent-child relationships that define process trees. In forensic terms, a process also leaves behind runtime artifacts that help analysts determine what was executed, how it behaved, and what resources it accessed.</p>

<h3>Linux vs Windows: Process Models</h3>
<p>In Linux, each process is internally represented by a structure called task_struct. This kernel-level data structure holds PID, state, memory pointers, CPU usage, and more information. Linux also treats threads as lightweight processes, meaning every thread has its own PID. It is managed similarly to full processes, with specific flags (via the clone() system call) differentiating thread behavior.<br><br>

On Windows, the equivalent structure is EPROCESS, which resides in kernel memory. Unlike Linux, threads in Windows exist as entities within a process; they do not have standalone identifiers visible like Linux threads do.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/333ce8ba-0915-4a54-bc2b-a09b66fd8434)

  
<h3>Anatomy of a Linux Process</h3>
<p>Linux offers transparent access to live process information through the /proc pseudo-filesystem. For example:</p>
<p>

- /proc/<pid>/cmdline provides command-line arguments.<br>

- /proc/<pid>/status shows metadata like UID, memory usage, and thread count.<br>

- /proc/<pid>/exe is a symlink to the binary executed.<br>

- /proc/<pid>/maps reveals memory layout.<br>

- /proc/<pid>/fd/ lists open file descriptors.</p>

<p>From a forensic perspective, Linux gives direct access to live process artifacts through the /proc filesystem. Analysts can check memory maps, open files, load libraries, and even inspect a running binary via symbolic links. This transparency is a powerful feature in Linux for live system analysis.</p>

<br>

<h2> Task 5 . Hunting for Suspicious Process</h2>
<p>Now that our lab machine is loaded, let's start examining the Linux memory image to find the footprints of the attack patterns. We may wonder where to begin our analysis. Let's start by reviewing the running processes on the machine at the time of the capture. We'll use Volatility to examine a Linux memory image placed in the folder on the Desktop. Our goal is to hunt for suspicious processes that may indicate compromise. This includes checking unusual process names, parent-child relationships, anomalous users, hidden processes, and privilege escalation attempts.</p>

<h3>Verifying the Hash</h3>
<p>Let's run the following command to verify the integrity of the Linux memory dump, as shown below:</p>

<p>Integrity Check</p>

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop/artifacts$ md5sum FS-01.mem      
c0fbf40989bda765b8edaa------  FS-01.mem
```

<p>As it will take time to process, the command output is already stored in the md5_hash file.</p>

<h3>Volatility Usage</h3>
<p>In this room, we will rely on Volatility 3 to extract the volatile footprints of the attack on the Linux machine at the time of the memory capture. Let's run the following command to get the Volatility help:</p>
<p>Command: vol3 --help</p>

<p>Volatility Help</p>

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop/artifacts$ vol3 --help

<h3>Linux Plugins</h3>
<p>We can use the grep to list down the available plugins for the Linux image, using the command vol3 --help | grep linux as shown below:</p>

<p>Available Linux Plugins</p>

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop/artifacts$ vol3 --help | grep linux

<h3>Identify the Correct Linux Banner</h3>
<p>Before starting to work with Volatility, it is important to note that Volatility version 2 is needed to identify the correct profile. Volatility 3, which we are using in this room, needs to have the symbols table of the Operating System version you are analyzing to understand the structure of the memory dump. </p>
<p>Command: vol3 -f FS-01.mem banners.Banners</p>

<h5>Forensics Value</h5>

<p>

- Displays all currently linked processes from the kernel task list.<br>
- Reflects what the live system’s ps or top commands would show.<br>
- Helps establish the baseline of visible processes at the time of capture.<br>
- Validates running services, daemons, shells, and tools.<br>
- Can help identify suspicious tools running (e.g., nc, python, wget).</p>


<h3>PsScan</h3>

<p>We can use the PsScan plugin to let Volatility scan the memory for the processes based on the signature and retrieve the hidden processes that the PsScan plugin may have missed.<br>

Note: The command will take about 2 minutes to fully execute.<br>

Command: vol3 -f FS-01.mem linux.psscan.PsScan</p>


<p>Terminal</p>

```

<p>The command output is already stored in the psscan_output file. Examine the output and see if you can find some processes with suspicious arguments. This scan is useful, especially in retrieving hidden or terminated processes with footprints still in memory.</p>

<h5>Forensics Value</h5>

- Detects hidden or unlinked processes, rootkits, etc.<br>
- Reveals terminated or orphaned processes still in memory.<br>
- Cross-referencing psscan with pslist helps find stealth malware.<br>
- Critical for post-compromise investigations where attackers attempt to hide activity.</p>

<h3>Processes With Arguments</h3>
<p>Another interesting plugin is psaux, which helps us retrieve processes with arguments. This plugin can be used to identify suspicious processes with odd-looking arguments passed to them.<br><br>

Command: vol3 -f FS-01.mem linux.psaux.PsAux</p>

```

<p>The command output is already stored in the psaux_output file. Examine the output and see if you can find some processes with suspicious arguments.</p> 

<h5>Forensics Value</h5>

- Provides the full command-line for each running process (like ps aux).<br>
- Reveals use of suspicious commands or flags (e.g., nc -e, curl http, bash -i).<br>
- Useful for reverse shell detection, malicious script execution, or credential theft.<br>
- Allows correlation between PID and behavior observed in other plugins (e.g., netstat or maps).<br>
- Helps differentiate legitimate vs. abused binaries.</p>


<h3>Process Mapping</h3>

<p>The plugin proc.Maps enumerates memory mappings for processes in a Linux memory dump. It mimics the contents of /proc/<pid>/maps on a live system, showing how each process maps executable files, shared libraries, heap/stack regions, and potentially malicious memory allocations into its address space.<br><br>

<p>As it will take time to process, the command output is stored in the procmap_output file. Examine the output and see if you can find some processes with suspicious arguments. </p>

<h5>Forensics Value</h5>

<p>

- Reveals how each process maps memory regions (executables, libraries, heap, stack, anonymous regions).<br>
- Detects in-memory malware(e.g., unpacked payloads, injected shellcode).<br>
- Flags suspicious permissions like rwxp (read-write-execute-private) are often used for shellcode.<br>
- Helps identify fileless malware, as memory segments may hold active code.<br>
- Detects processes loading binaries from suspicious paths (e.g., /tmp/).<br>
- Allows reconstruction of process layout to correlate with behavior or anomaly.<br>
- Essential for confirming the process of hollowing or injection.</p>

<h2> Task 6 . Hunting for Suspicious Network Activities</h2>
<p>Analyzing memory for suspicious network connections is crucial when investigating malware, persistence, or lateral movement. Attackers often use reverse shells, backdoors, or tunnels; memory may be the only place to detect them. In the memory, we can look for the footprints of the network connections and hunt for the suspicious ones.<br><br>

Some of the key information we can look for in terms of network connection in the Linux memory is:</p>

<p>

- Open Network connections
- Reverse Shell
- Socket details
- Network Interfaces</p>

<h3>Identify IP Information</h3>

```

<p>Note: The command takes about 2 minutes to fully execute. You can also find the information stored in the socket_output file.<br><br>

Let's break down some key information we get from this command:</p>


<p>

- Process Name: Name of the process using the socket (from /proc/<pid>/comm).<br>
- PID: Process ID that owns the socket.<br>
- Source Address: the file path bound to the socket.<br>
- STATE: Socket state: LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, UNCONNECTED, etc.<br>
- Source Port / Destination Port: Source Port / Destination Port associated with the socket.</p>

<h5>Forensics Value</h5>
<p>

- Detects overall network activity from the kernel’s view, helping confirm if the system was engaged in active connections during the memory capture. <br>
- Identifies potential backdoors or reverse shells by revealing unexpected socket usage.<br>
- Helps examine and hunt for abnormal socket counts or excessive memory usage allocated to network connections.</p>

<p>Investigating the footprints of network-based activity in memory is an important part of forensics. It provides visibility into all networking layers: -interfaces, IP configurations, and socket-level behavior.<br><br>

Examine the network connections and see if you can find any suspicious connections and associated processes.</p>

<h2> Task 7 . Hunting for User Activities</h2>
<p>When a system is compromised, attackers typically interact with it through command-line tools like bash, sh, or python. Their footprints are often left behind in memory long after processes have terminated. By analyzing shell history, terminal usage, and related metadata, we can reconstruct what commands were run, by whom, and in what context.</p>

<h3>Bash History</h3>

<p>We can use the following command to locate the footprints of the command history from users’ Bash sessions (.bash_history or in-memory structures), offering direct insight into what actions a user performed.<br><br>

Command: vol3 -f FS-01.mem linux.bash.Bash</p>

<p>We can also extract the traces of the environment variables from the memory. This may be useful if the attacker has planted suspicious binaries in a custom location and altered the PATH variable to prioritize the execution.<br><br>

Command: vol3 -f FS-01.mem linux.envars.Envars</p>

<p>Checking Environment Variables</p>

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop/artifacts$ vol3 -f FS-01.mem linux.envars.Envars
Volatility 3 Framework 2.26.2
PID    PPID    COMM    KEY    VALUE
1    0    systemd    HOME    /
1    0    systemd    TERM    linux
1    0    systemd    BOOT_IMAGE    /boot/vmlinuz-5.15.0-1066-aws
170    1    systemd-journal    LANG    C.UTF-8
170    1    systemd-journal    PATH    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin
170    1    systemd-journal    NOTIFY_SOCKET    /run/systemd/notify
```

<p>The command's output is already placed in the envars_output file.</p>

<h5>Forensics Value:</h5>

- Reveals execution context of processes, including directories, shells, and user settings.<br>
- Detects malicious environment manipulation, such as modified PATH.<br>
- Uncovers persistence mechanisms through environment-based startup configurations.<br>
- Correlates with other process artifacts to enrich the investigation context.</p>

<p>In conclusion, understanding user behavior is critical for identifying unauthorized access, malicious actions, and post-exploitation traces.</p>

<h2> Task 8 . Conclusion</h2>

<p>That's it.<br><br>

In this room, we examined a Linux memory dump to look for the footprints of the adversary on the compromised Linux host. Some of the key points we covered are:<br><br>

- Identify suspicious process.<br>
- Identify the hidden process running from the tmp directory.<br>
- Examine the processes with suspicious arguments.<br>
- Examine the bash history.<br>
- Explore network connections and identify reverse shell connections.</p>

<p>You can learn more about forensics in the following rooms:<br>
