<h2> Task 1 . Introduction</h2>

<h3>Set up your virtual environment</h3>
<p>To successfully complete this room, you'll need to set up your virtual environment. This involves starting the Task Machine, ensuring you're equipped with the necessary tools and access to tackle the challenges ahead.</p>

<p>[  Target machine  ]</p>

<p>In the previous room, Memory Analysis Introduction, we learnt about the vital nature of memory forensics in cyber security. We explored the structure of memory dumps, differentiated between RAM and disk forensics, and saw scenarios where memory analysis is essential.<br><br>

Here, we shall begin looking at the practical aspects of memory forensics through tools, specifically Volatility.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>

- Getting familiar with the Volatility Framework<br>
- Navigate and utilise basic Volatility commands and plugins<br>
- Conduct forensic analysis to identify key artefacts such as running processes and loaded DLLs using Volatility.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<h2>Task 2 . Volatility Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://volatilityfoundation.org/the-volatility-framework/">Volatility</a> is an open-source memory forensics framework that is cross-platform, modular, and extensible. The framework has undergone various iterations over the years, with the current version being Volatility 3. This version is superior to its predecessors as it abandoned static OS profiling in favour of dynamic symbol resolution, supporting newer operating systems, memory layouts, and complete insight into the runtime state of the system.</p>

<h3>Architectural Overview</h3>

<p>Volatility 3 is made up of several key layers:<br>

- <code>Memory layers</code>: These layers represent the hierarchy of address spaces, from raw memory to virtual address translations.<br>
- <code>Symbol tables</code>: The tables enable kernel and process structures to be interpreted through OS-specific debugging symbols.<br>
- <code>Plugins</code>: These are modular routines that leverage the underlying memory layers and symbol tables to extract artefacts of forensic interest. Later in the room, we shall look at some key plugins used.</p>

<h3>System Requirements and Installation</h3>

<p>Volatility 3 requires Python 3.6 or later to run. Additionally, it benefits from various libraries such as <code>pefile</code>, <code>capstone</code>, and <code>yata-python</code> that allow us to process portable executables, perform memory disassembly, and use YARA rules in our analysis, respectively. The terminal output below shows how to install Volatility by cloning the<a href="https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git">GitHub Repository</a> and running it directly from the source.<br><br>

Volatility has already been installed on the machine attached to this room and can be accessed under the <code>Desktop/volatility3</code> directory.</p>

<h2>Task 3 . Memory Acquisition and Analysis</h2>

<h3>Memory Acquisition Methodologies</h3>

<p>Memory acquisition is a foundational step in forensics that must be performed in a manner that ensures we maintain the integrity of evidence. The process and the deployment environment used vary from one OS to another.</p>

<p>For Windows systems, the following tools can be used to conduct memory acquisition:<br>

- <code>DumpIt</code>: captures a full physical memory image on 32/64‑bit Windows and automatically hashes the output.<br>
- <code>WinPmem</code>: Open‑source driver‑based tool that acquires RAM in RAW/ELF formats and embeds acquisition metadata for chain‑of‑custody.<br>
- <code>Magnet RAM Capture</code>: GUI‑driven collector that snapshots volatile memory on live Windows hosts while minimising footprint.<br>
- <code>FTK Imager</code>: The most common commercial tool that acquires memory and selected logical artefacts alongside disk imaging functions. </p>

<p>For Linux and macOS systems,  we can employ the services of the following tools:<br>

- <code>AVML</code>: Lightweight Microsoft CLI utility that dumps Linux memory to a compressed ELF file without requiring a kernel module.<br>
- <code>LiME</code>: Loadable Kernel Module for Linux that captures full volatile memory over disk or network and supports ARM/x86 architectures.<br>
- <code>OSXPmem</code>: macOS‑specific fork of Pmem that creates raw memory images on Intel‑based Macs for subsequent Volatility analysis.</p>
